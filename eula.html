<main class="pt-0 pb-20 px-4 md:px-12 max-w-5xl mx-auto space-y-6">
<h1 class="text-4xl font-bold title-font mb-8 gradient-text text-center">End User License Agreement (EULA)</h1>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold title-font mt-6">1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
<p class="text-slate-300">By accessing, installing, or using the CrossyBot software (“the Software”), you agree to be legally bound by these Terms of Service (“Terms”). If you do not agree with any part of the Terms, you must not use the Software.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300">You confirm that you are at least 18 years old and are not located in, or a citizen or resident of, any jurisdiction where use of the Software is prohibited by applicable law, regulation, or sanctions, including but not limited to those listed in Section [Prohibited Jurisdictions].</p>
<p class="text-slate-300">Use of the Software constitutes your full and unconditional acceptance of these Terms, and any future updates or modifications, which may be made at any time without prior notice. It is your responsibility to review the Terms periodically. Continued use of the Software after any changes constitutes acceptance of those changes.</p>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold title-font mt-6">2. Description of Service</h2>
<p class="text-slate-300">CrossyBot is an execution-only cryptocurrency trading automation tool. It enables users to automate trade execution based on user-defined parameters such as EMA crossover strategies. The Software integrates with the Kraken API using user-provided API keys and offers a Telegram-based interface for interaction and control.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300">CrossyBot is strictly a tool for executing user-directed actions. It does not provide financial, investment, or trading advice, and should not be relied upon as such. Users retain full control and responsibility over all trading decisions and parameters.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300">The client application is self-hosted by users, either on their own Windows device or optionally on a cloud-hosted EC2 instance. The CrossyBot API backend is hosted on a third-party platform and facilitates necessary supporting functions (e.g., account management, credit accounting, email notifications), but does not initiate trades or manage user funds.</p>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold title-font mt-6">3. License Grant</h2>
<p class="text-slate-300">CrossyBot grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Software solely for your personal or internal commercial purposes, in accordance with these Terms.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300">You may not sell, rent, lease, sublicense, distribute, or otherwise transfer or make the Software available to any third party. You may not modify, reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any part of the Software except as permitted by law.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300">This license is conditional on your continued compliance with these Terms and may be terminated at any time without notice if you breach any part of this agreement.</p>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold title-font mt-6">4. User Representations &amp; Warranties</h2>

<p class="text-slate-300">All funds used via the Software are lawfully obtained and not derived from any illegal activity, including money laundering or terrorist financing.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300">You are not subject to any sanctions, embargoes, or restrictions imposed by the UK, UN, OFAC, EU, or any other relevant authority, and you are not located in or a resident/citizen of any jurisdiction where use of the Software is prohibited.</p>
<p class="text-slate-300">You agree to promptly cease all use of the Software if any of the above representations become untrue.</p>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold title-font mt-6">5. User Obligations</h2>

<p class="text-slate-300">Maintain the security and confidentiality of your API keys, Telegram credentials, and device(s) running the Software.</p>

<p class="text-slate-300">Any violation of these obligations may result in immediate termination of your access and may be reported to the appropriate authorities.</p>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold title-font mt-6">6. Prohibited Jurisdictions</h2>

<p class="text-slate-300">You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless CrossyBot, its developer(s), affiliates, and service providers from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, penalties, costs, or expenses (including legal fees) arising out of or related to:</p>
<p class="text-slate-300">Your use or misuse of the Software;</p>
<p class="text-slate-300">Any breach of these Terms;</p>
<p class="text-slate-300">Any violation of applicable law or regulation;</p>
<p class="text-slate-300">Any third-party claims or regulatory actions resulting from your actions or use of the Software.</p>

<p class="text-slate-300">API keys and Telegram bot tokens are stored locally on your device and are never transmitted to CrossyBot servers. The local database is encrypted using SQLCipher and decrypted only at runtime.
